## How to Import CSV Files into an ASP.NET Core App (Using CSVBox)

Importing CSV files is a common task for ASP.NET Core developers‚Äîespecially in business apps that manage data like users, orders, inventory, or analytics. But building secure and user-friendly CSV import functionality from scratch can be time-consuming and error-prone.

This step-by-step guide explains how to integrate CSV importing into your ASP.NET Core application using [CSVBox](https://csvbox.io), a robust tool that simplifies:

- Upload UI
- Data validations
- Field mapping
- Webhook-based delivery

Ideal for SaaS teams, internal tools, and enterprise dashboards.

---

## Why Use a CSV Import Tool in ASP.NET Core?

While ASP.NET Core is excellent for modern web APIs and apps, adding a complete CSV upload pipeline often requires:

- Manual CSV parsing and line-by-line validation
- Custom HTML and JavaScript UI for users
- Error tracking and rollback logic
- Security and sanitization steps

Instead of building all of this yourself, CSVBox offers:

- A secure drag-and-drop widget with field mapping
- Client-side validation (required, regex, data types)
- Server-side webhook delivery with structured JSON
- Real-time error feedback for end-users

---

## Use Cases for CSV Uploads

Some questions this solution addresses:

- ‚ÄúHow can my users bulk upload product data into our ASP.NET Core app?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIs there a secure CSV uploader that supports row validation and mapping?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the fastest way to build a CSV import feature into my Razor Pages project?‚Äù

Examples include:

- A CRM importing customer contacts
- A SaaS analytics platform uploading usage data
- A logistics dashboard updating delivery records in bulk

## Step-by-Step: Integrate CSVBox into ASP.NET Core

### 1. Sign Up for CSVBox and Create a Widget

- Go to [CSVBox.io](https://csvbox.io) and create an account.
- Set up a new import widget via the dashboard:
  - Define the expected fields (e.g., name, email, phone).
  - Apply validation rules (e.g., required, regex, unique).
  - Customize field mapping if needed.
- Copy your widget key ‚Äî you‚Äôll use this in your frontend.

### 2. Set Up or Create Your ASP.NET Core Project

If you don‚Äôt have a project yet:

```bash
dotnet new webapp -n CsvImportApp
cd CsvImportApp
```

Make sure you‚Äôre using ASP.NET Core 3.1+ (supports modern JSON parsing and endpoints).

### 3. Add a Webhook Endpoint to Receive CSV Data

CSVBox sends user-uploaded data to your server in JSON format. In your ASP.NET Core app:

Create a controller:

```csharp
// Controllers/CsvImportController.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class CsvImportController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost("csvbox-webhook")]
    public IActionResult ReceiveCsvRecords([FromBody] JObject payload)
    {
        var records = payload["data"]?["records"];
        foreach (var record in records)
        {
            var name = record["name"]?.ToString();
            var email = record["email"]?.ToString();
            // Save to database here
        }
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

Make sure JSON body parsing (using Newtonsoft or System.Text.Json) is enabled.

You can use tools like Postman or ngrok to test the endpoint.

### 4. Embed the CSVBox Widget in a Razor Page

To provide a friendly file upload UI, embed the CSVBox widget:

```html
<!-- Pages/Upload.cshtml -->
@page
@model UploadModel

@section Scripts {
  <script src="https://js.csvbox.io/widget.js"></script>
  <script>
    var csvbox = new CSVBoxWidget({
      widgetKey: "your_widget_key_here",
      user: {
        id: "user_id",  // Optional for session identification
        email: "user@example.com"
      },
      onUploadComplete: function(result) {
        console.log("Upload complete:", result);
      }
    });
    csvbox.mount("#csvbox-uploader");
  </script>
}

<h2>Upload Your CSV File</h2>
<div id="csvbox-uploader"></div>
```

Replace your_widget_key_here with your actual key from CSVBox.

---

## Sample Webhook Payload Format

CSVBox POSTs incoming data to your server in this structure:

```json
{
  "event": "upload.completed",
  "data": {
    "records": [
      { "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" },
      { "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com" }
    ],
    "upload_id": "abc123"
  }
}
```

This makes it easy to loop through and persist rows.

---

## Bonus: Webhook Security (Optional)

To ensure the webhook call is authentic, CSVBox sends a signature header:

```csharp
string signature = Request.Headers["X-Csvbox-Signature"];
// Verify this signature with your secret
```

More on this in the [official docs](https://help.csvbox.io/developer-guide/6.-webhooks#security).

---

## Common Issues and Fixes

Here are some frequent issues and how to resolve them:

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| No data received in webhook | ‚úÖ Make sure the endpoint is publicly accessible and uses `[HttpPost]`. |
| 500 error on upload | ‚úÖ Inspect JSON model binding or null values in the payload. |
| JavaScript widget doesn‚Äôt render | ‚úÖ Confirm `csvbox.js` is included and the widget key is valid. |
| Need to test locally | ‚úÖ Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your webhook. |
