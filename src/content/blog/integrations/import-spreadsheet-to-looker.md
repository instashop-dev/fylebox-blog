## How to Import Spreadsheet Data into Looker Using CSVBox

Integrating spreadsheet uploads into a Looker-powered analytics stack can be challenging‚Äîbut the right tools make it seamless. Whether you're building a SaaS platform, managing a low-code product, or leading data infrastructure for a startup, this guide shows you how to efficiently go from Excel or CSV to Looker dashboards with minimal friction.

### Why This Matters

Many business users still rely heavily on spreadsheets‚Äîstoring everything from customer data and KPIs to campaign metrics and sales forecasts. If your application or team depends on Looker for BI, it‚Äôs essential to bridge the gap between user-uploaded spreadsheets and your Looker models.

The problem? Looker doesn't support direct spreadsheet uploads.
The solution? Use a secure, scalable importer like CSVBox to load spreadsheets into a connected data warehouse Looker can query.

## Overview: Steps to Connect Spreadsheet Uploads to Looker

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown to help technical teams implement spreadsheet ingestion into Looker using CSVBox:

### 1. Understand Looker's Data Model

Looker doesn‚Äôt store data‚Äîit queries it live from external sources such as:

- Google BigQuery
- Amazon Redshift
- Snowflake
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL

üí° Goal: Upload spreadsheet data into one of those sources, then model it in Looker.

### 2. Set Up a Destination Database

Pick a connected database that Looker can read from. You‚Äôll need:

- Active connection in Looker (with appropriate credentials)
- A target table for storing user-uploaded data

Example:
- sales_data table in BigQuery  
- customer_onboarding_data table in Snowflake

‚úÖ Make sure your data warehouse allows write access from your app/backend.

### 3. Use CSVBox to Enable Spreadsheet Upload

CSVBox lets you add a ready-made import button inside your web app or admin portal‚Äîmaking it simple for users to upload CSV or Excel files.

Steps:

1. Sign up at [CSVBox](https://csvbox.io)
2. Create a new Importer
3. Define the expected data schema (fields, validations, format)
4. Integrate the CSVBox widget in your frontend

Example integration:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/csvbox"></script>

<button id="csvbox-launch">Import Spreadsheet</button>

<script>
  CSVBox.init({
    user: { email: "user@example.com" },
    licenseKey: "YOUR_CSVBOX_LICENSE_KEY",
    onImportComplete: function (data) {
      // Send rows to backend or database
      console.log(data);
    }
  });

  document.getElementById('csvbox-launch').addEventListener('click', CSVBox.launch);
</script>
```

### 4. Move Uploaded Data into Your Database

After upload, CSVBox gives you validated, structured spreadsheet rows. You can POST this to your own backend, then insert into your database.

Example using Node.js:

```js
app.post('/upload', async (req, res) => {
  const rows = req.body.data; // array of cleaned rows
  await db.batchInsert('sales_data', rows); // use your DB library
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'success' });
});
```

‚úÖ Sanitize inputs and handle duplicates or schema mismatches here.

### 5. Define LookML to Model the Data

Once the spreadsheet data lives in your warehouse, create a LookML model to expose it in Looker:

```lookml
view: sales_data {
  sql_table_name: sales_data ;;

  dimension: customer_name {
    type: string
    sql: ${TABLE}.customer_name ;;
  }

  measure: total_sales {
    type: sum
    sql: ${TABLE}.amount ;;
  }
}
```

Now the imported spreadsheet data can be used in dashboards, visualizations, and explorable reports.

## Common Pitfalls (and How to Prevent Them)

Here are the most frequent issues developers run into when implementing spreadsheet-to-Looker pipelines:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 1. Unsupported File Types

- CSVBox supports both `.csv` and `.xlsx`
- Define schema & required fields via dashboard to disallow invalid uploads

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Column/Data Type Mismatches

- Ensure frontend and database schema match
- CSVBox helps with field-level validations (e.g., dates, emails, numbers)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Duplicate Records

- Use upsert logic in your backend rather than blind inserts
- Compare unique identifiers if present in each upload

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Large File Uploads

- Chunk uploads server-side
- Use CSVBox‚Äôs webhook to process data upon completion

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 5. Out-of-Sync Data in Looker

- Looker can cache queries‚Äîuse persistent derived tables (PDTs) when needed
- Control freshness with `persist_for` settings or refetch intervals
