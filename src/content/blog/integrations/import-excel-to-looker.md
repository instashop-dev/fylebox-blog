## How to Import Excel Spreadsheets into Looker Using CSVBox

For many SaaS platforms, enabling users to upload Excel files and visualize data in Looker adds real business value ‚Äî especially in analytics-heavy environments. While Looker is a powerful BI platform, it doesn‚Äôt natively support direct Excel (.xlsx or .xls) file uploads. This creates a gap for product and engineering teams.

In this guide, you'll learn how to overcome this limitation using CSVBox, a purpose-built file import tool that simplifies spreadsheet ingestion into your data pipeline ‚Äî making real-time dashboards in Looker possible from Excel inputs.

## Workflow Overview: Excel to Looker in 4 Steps

1. Convert Excel files to CSV
2. Use CSVBox to collect and validate uploaded spreadsheets
3. Send validated data into your database via webhook
4. Model and visualize data in Looker

---

## 1. Convert Excel Files to CSV-Compatible Format

Looker doesn‚Äôt read raw Excel files directly. The first step is to convert uploads into a format your backend can process.

Options include:

- Ask users to upload .csv files directly
- Use a file importer like CSVBox that supports .xlsx, .xls, and .csv natively and parses them automatically

Tip: Accepting multiple formats improves user experience and reduces friction.

## 2. Use CSVBox to Embed a File Importer Inside Your App

CSVBox is a developer-friendly spreadsheet import widget that eliminates the need for building a custom ingestion feature from scratch. It takes care of file validation, schema enforcement, field mapping, and user feedback.

### Key Benefits:
- Upload support for `.xlsx`, `.xls`, and `.csv`
- Schema validation before data ever hits your backend
- Automatic or manual column mapping
- Fully embeddable UI that matches your app's look and feel

### How to Add It:
1. Create a free account at [csvbox.io](https://csvbox.io)
2. Define your data schema
3. Generate a widget license key
4. Embed this snippet in your front-end code:

```html
<script src="https://widget.csvbox.io/widget.js"></script>
<div id="csvbox"></div>
<script>
  CSVBox.init({
    selector: "#csvbox",
    licenseKey: "YOUR_WIDGET_KEY",
    user: {
      id: "user_123",
      email: "user@example.com"
    },
    onImportComplete: function(result) {
      // Trigger ETL or storage logic
      console.log('Import Completed', result);
    }
  });
</script>
```

## 3. POST Imported Data to Your Database via Webhook

Once the file is uploaded and validated, CSVBox sends the data to your backend via a webhook. From there, you can load it into a data warehouse that Looker can query from.

Common data destinations for Looker integration include:

- Google BigQuery
- Snowflake
- Amazon Redshift
- PostgreSQL

Example webhook receiver in Node.js:

```js
app.post('/csvbox/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body.data;

  // Insert into your data store
  insertIntoDatabase(data);

  res.status(200).send('Received');
});
```

## 4. Visualize the Data in Looker

Once the validated data lands in your warehouse:

- Use LookML to define models, dimensions, and measures
- Create custom Explores and dashboards in Looker Studio
- Enable non-technical users to view Excel-uploaded data with real-time charts

üéØ Bonus: All of this can happen without requiring users to touch SQL or leave your product.
