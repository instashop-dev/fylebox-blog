## Step-by-Step: Set Up a No-Code CSV Upload Flow in Bubble

Here‚Äôs how to integrate CSVbox into your Bubble app in just a few steps.

### 1. Create Your Upload Widget in CSVbox

1. Visit the [CSVbox Dashboard](https://app.csvbox.io/).
2. Click on ‚ÄúNew Widget‚Äù.
3. Define the upload schema (e.g., `email`, `name`, `signup_date`).
4. Add validations (required fields, date formats, column types).
5. Under ‚ÄúDestination‚Äù, choose **Webhook** and prepare a Bubble endpoint URL.

üìö For advanced options, see: [CSVbox Destination Docs](https://help.csvbox.io/destinations)

### 2. Embed the CSV Upload Widget into Bubble

1. In CSVbox, go to the widget ‚Üí Install Code tab.
2. Copy the embed snippet (JavaScript).
3. In your Bubble app, place an HTML element where you want the uploader.
4. Paste the embed code inside that element.

Your uploader will now render seamlessly in the front-end.

### 3. Set Up a Bubble Backend Workflow

1. In Bubble, go to ‚ÄúBackend Workflows‚Äù.
   - If disabled, enable API workflows under Settings ‚Üí API.
2. Create a new API workflow (e.g., `process_csv_row`).
3. Add parameters for your CSV fields: 
   - `email` (type: text)
   - `name` (type: text)
   - `created_date` (type: date)
4. Add actions to create or update Things in your database using these params.

üìå Bubble expects a JSON POST payload. Make sure you're setting the correct Content-Type in incoming requests.

### 4. Connect the CSVbox Widget to Bubble

1. Copy your Bubble workflow‚Äôs public endpoint URL (e.g., `https://myapp.bubbleapps.io/api/1.1/wf/process_csv_row`)
2. Paste it into your CSVbox widget‚Äôs Destination settings.
3. Save and test the upload with a sample CSV.

‚úÖ On every upload, CSVbox will validate rows on the client side, then send each row to your Bubble workflow via webhook POST request.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Keep your import flow bulletproof by watching for these gotchas:

- ‚ùå Backend workflows not enabled in Bubble
- ‚ùå Missing or incorrect `Content-Type: application/json` in CSVbox payloads
- ‚ùå Field name mismatches between CSVbox schema and Bubble workflow params
- ‚ùå Unhandled data type conversions (e.g., date strings, numbers with commas)
- ‚ùå Not testing with realistic sample CSV files

üîç Tip: Use real-world test data to fully simulate user uploads before going live.
