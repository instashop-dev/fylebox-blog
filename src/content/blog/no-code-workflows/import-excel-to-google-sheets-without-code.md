## Step-by-Step: Automatically Import Excel Files into Google Sheets

### 1. Configure Your CSVBox Importer

Visit [CSVBox.io](https://csvbox.io) and:

1. Create a free account.
2. Launch your first “Importer” from the dashboard.
3. Define the data schema (column headers, field types). Tip: Upload a sample Excel or CSV file to auto-detect your schema.

CSVBox handles:

- Parsing both .xls/.xlsx and CSV formats
- Real-time data validation (required fields, data types, etc)
- Header mapping for flexible data ingestion

---

### 2. Customize Upload Experience

Tailor your uploader widget using the CSVBox dashboard:

- Set instructions, button text, and color branding that match your app or website
- Choose accepted formats: CSV, XLS, XLSX
- Add validations like required fields, number formats, or custom regex

This ensures users only upload clean, usable data—before it ever touches your spreadsheet.

---

### 3. Embed the Widget Anywhere

From your CSVBox dashboard:

1. Copy the embed code (HTML or JavaScript snippet)
2. Paste it into your:
   - Web app (React, Vue, etc.)
   - No-code tools like Webflow, Bubble, or Wix
   - Internal admin portal or landing page

Now your users have a branded interface where they can submit data securely.

---

### 4. Connect CSVBox to Google Sheets

Once data starts flowing into CSVBox, route it to Google Sheets with one of these options:

#### ✅ Option A: Zapier (Fast and Simple)

- Trigger: CSVBox → New Row Uploaded
- Action: Google Sheets → Create Spreadsheet Row
- Map CSVBox fields to your sheet columns
- Test and go live in minutes

Use this to get fully automated data delivery to Sheets, plus optional Slack or email alerts.

#### 🔁 Option B: Webhook + Make.com (More Control)

- In CSVBox, go to:
  Importer → Settings → Destinations → Add “Webhook”
- Use Webhook URLs from Make, Pipedream, or your backend
- In Make, connect to Google Sheets to insert each row

Use Webhooks if you need logic like conditionals, database storage, or multi-step integrations.
