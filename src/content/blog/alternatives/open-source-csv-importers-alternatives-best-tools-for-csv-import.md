## ⚙️ Popular Open-Source CSV Import Libraries

Open-source CSV import tools work well in early-stage apps or internal tooling. Here are a few popular options:

### Notable Tools:
- [react-csv-reader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-csv-reader)
- [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/)
- [SheetJS](https://sheetjs.com/)
- Flatfile Lite (limited feature set from Flatfile)

Among them, one of the most commonly used is `react-csv-reader`. It’s lightweight, React-friendly, and good for fast prototyping.

#### react-csv-reader Highlights:
- ✅ Works with file select or drag-and-drop
- ✅ Converts simple CSV files to JSON
- 🚫 Lacks built-in schema validation
- 🚫 No analytics or import monitoring
- 🚫 Difficult to support large files or async uploads

While these libraries can be integrated fairly quickly, they often require significant custom development to handle production needs such as data validation, error feedback, and user-friendly UX.
