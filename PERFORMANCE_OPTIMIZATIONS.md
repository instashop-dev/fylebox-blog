# Site Performance Optimizations for FCP and LCP

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Critical CSS Inline & Render-Blocking Fix
- **Expanded inline critical CSS** in `Head.astro` for complete above-the-fold styling
- **Non-blocking CSS loading** using `preload` with `onload` fallback pattern
- **Disabled CSS code splitting** to prevent multiple render-blocking requests
- **Always inline stylesheets** in Astro config for better FCP
- Added `noscript` fallbacks for CSS loading reliability

### 2. Font Loading Optimization
- Added `font-display: swap` to prevent invisible text during font swap
- Preconnect to Google Fonts with crossorigin attribute
- **Non-blocking font loading** using preload pattern
- Self-hosted font fallbacks with optimal unicode ranges
- CSS Font Loading API optimization for existing fonts

### 3. Script Loading Optimization
- **CSS optimizer script** loaded first for critical path optimization
- Deferred Flowbite loading until after page load
- Converted blocking scripts to async/defer
- Lazy loaded non-critical JavaScript modules
- Optimized service worker registration

### 4. Resource Preloading
- Preconnect to critical origins (fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com, cdn.jsdelivr.net)
- DNS prefetch for third-party resources
- **Non-blocking preload** for critical CSS files
- Priority hints for important resources

### 5. Image Optimization
- Enhanced `OptimizedImage.astro` component with:
  - `fetchpriority="high"` for above-the-fold images
  - Proper loading strategies (eager vs lazy)
  - Responsive image generation with WebP support
  - Proper aspect ratios to prevent CLS
  - Optimized quality settings

### 6. Build Optimizations
- **CSS code splitting disabled** to prevent render-blocking requests
- **Always inline stylesheets** for better FCP
- Manual chunks for better caching
- Optimized asset file naming
- Prefetch configuration for viewport-based loading

### 7. Performance Monitoring
- Created `performance-optimizer.js` with:
  - Web Vitals tracking (FCP, LCP)
  - Intersection Observer for lazy loading
  - Critical resource preloading
  - DOM optimization techniques

### 8. CSS Loading Optimization
- **`css-optimizer.js`** script for advanced CSS loading
- Async CSS loading utility functions
- Font loading optimization with CSS Font Loading API
- Non-critical CSS deferral patterns

### 9. Layout Stability
- Added aspect ratio attributes to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Proper sizing for images and media elements
- Optimized CSS for minimal reflows
- Extended critical CSS coverage for better initial paint

## Expected Performance Improvements

### First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- **Before**: Blocked by external stylesheets and fonts
- **After**: Critical CSS inlined, fonts/CSS load non-blocking, expanded critical coverage

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- **Before**: Large images blocking render, CSS blocking critical path
- **After**: Non-blocking CSS, priority hints, WebP format, responsive images, preloading

### Render-Blocking Resources
- **Before**: `/_astro/_slug_.m75EQqFx.css` blocking initial render
- **After**: CSS inlined or loaded asynchronously, no render-blocking external CSS

### Additional Benefits
- **Eliminated render-blocking CSS**: All CSS loads non-blocking or is inlined
- **Reduced JavaScript blocking time**: Scripts load asynchronously
- **Better caching**: Manual chunks and optimized build output
- **Improved mobile performance**: Responsive images and optimized fonts
- **Enhanced user experience**: Faster perceived loading times

## Performance Testing Recommendations

1. **Use Lighthouse** to measure Core Web Vitals before/after
2. **Test on 3G network** to simulate real-world conditions
3. **Monitor field data** with tools like PageSpeed Insights
4. **Check mobile performance** specifically for LCP improvements
5. **Verify no render-blocking resources** in DevTools Network tab

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. Implement critical path CSS extraction automation
2. Add image lazy loading with blur placeholders
3. Consider service worker caching strategies
4. Optimize third-party scripts (analytics, etc.)
5. Implement resource hints for subsequent pages

All optimizations are production-ready and follow Core Web Vitals best practices. The render-blocking CSS issue has been resolved through comprehensive CSS loading optimization.
